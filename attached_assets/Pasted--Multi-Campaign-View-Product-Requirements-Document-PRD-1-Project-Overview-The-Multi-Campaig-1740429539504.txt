üìä Multi-Campaign View ‚Äì Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Project Overview

The Multi-Campaign View aims to empower brand managers, adtech account managers, shopper marketing managers, Pathformance consultants, and internal engineers to analyze and compare multiple campaigns across various dimensions. This feature enhances data visibility, drives data-backed decisions, and ensures transparency in campaign performance while maintaining system scalability for future enhancements.

2. Objectives

Enable users to view and analyze multiple campaigns side-by-side.

Support granular filtering (by retailer, brand, vendor, event, holiday, geography, etc.)

Provide visualizations that help users identify overlaps, trends, and performance drivers.

Deliver actionable insights without introducing AI or complex measurement algorithms.

Ensure the architecture supports future AI integration without overpromising its immediate inclusion.

3. User Personas & Use Cases

üë©‚Äçüíº Brand Manager

Goal: Optimize marketing strategies across 10+ sub-brands, hundreds of SKUs, dozens of retailers, and multiple activation partners.

Use Case:

View all campaigns from the past year.

Filter by retailers, sub-brands, events, holidays, media partners, and more.

Compare campaigns by specific KPIs (e.g., ROAS, incremental sales, impressions).

Analyze single campaigns or aggregated views across sub-brands or regions.

üë®‚Äçüíª AdTech Account Manager

Goal: Monitor and report media performance for multiple clients and competing brands.

Use Case:

Aggregate performance across categories or individual clients.

Filter by brand, media partner, or campaign objective.

Compare multiple tactics (including those run by other vendors) to showcase media impact.

Use visual tools (heat maps, overlap charts) to illustrate campaign intersections.

Warn clients when multiple campaigns could be counting incremental sales twice.

üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Team

Goal: Build scalable, maintainable solutions that support future enhancements.

Use Case:

Design data structures that allow future AI applications without introducing AI now.

Ensure system stability with increased data load from multi-campaign views.

Maintain consistency with existing measurement methodologies.

4. Core Features & Functional Requirements

Columns Include: Campaign Name, Retailer, Brand, Start/End Dates, Budget, Impressions, CPM, ROAS, Sales Lift %, Incremental $, Test Store Count, etc.

Filtering & Sorting:

Align filters with other visualizations for consistent data views

Sort by any column (e.g., highest ROAS, lowest budget)

Export Options: CSV, Excel, PDF

üó∫Ô∏è 4. Geographic Heatmap ‚Äì Regional Performance Insights

Default View: A heatmap showing regional performance by metrics like Impressions, Budget, Sales, etc.

Data Granularity: National, State, DMA, or Store-Level (if available)

Selectable Metrics:

Impressions

Budget

Total Sales

Incremental Sales

ROAS

Features:

Tooltip pop-ups for regional summaries

Layer multiple metrics (e.g., compare Impressions vs. Sales Lift on the same map)

ü§ñ AI Widget ‚Äì Generative AI Dashboard Assistant

Purpose: Provide users with a natural language description of the data visualizations based on active filters and views.

Functionality:

Pop-out AI widget available on the dashboard.

Users can request a full summary of the dashboard or ask specific questions about the data.

The AI will NOT make recommendations or predictive analyses but will instead offer a detailed narrative of the charts and key insights.

Example: ‚ÄúThe bar chart shows Campaign A leading in ROAS with 3.5x, while Campaign B had the highest impressions. The geographic heatmap highlights the Midwest as the top-performing region.‚Äù

Future-Proofing:

Designed as a stepping stone for future AI integration.

Reinforces user engagement and data comprehension.

5. Wireframe Instructions

Dashboard Layout:

Place the Bar Chart at the top for high-level comparisons.

Include the Multi-Line Chart below for temporal trend analysis.

Position the Tabular View to the right or bottom for granular data.

Include the Geographic Heatmap in a dedicated section or as a selectable tab.

Filter Panel:

Consistent filter options across all visualizations (date range, media partner, retailer, etc.)

Global filter controls that impact all views.

AI Widget Integration:

Pop-out interface on the right side of the dashboard.

Search bar to input natural language questions.

Button for ‚ÄúGenerate Full Summary‚Äù to create paragraph descriptions of the dashboard.

User Experience Flow:
